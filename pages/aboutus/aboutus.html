                    Our present company name was established in 1932 and is a continuation of the original company,
                    Grady Bros. Co., started by F. S. Grady in 1932. Although our beginning was small, today we employ
                    nearly 50 persons in our working season, and have an investment of more than three million dollars
                    in machinery.

                    Our construction crews are employed by the City and State to build, repave and repair roads,
                    highways and parks. We work for many of the area's leading architects, builders and developers. We
                    build parking lots for the community's airports, churches, schools and industry. Our list of
                    satisfied clientele includes the Indy 500. We are honored to be one of Indianapolis Motor Speedway's
                    selected contractors.

                    Today we enjoy the reputation of one of the best asphalt firms in Indianapolis. You don't get a
                    reputation like that; you don't grow like Grady Brothers, Inc. by accident. It takes hard work and a
                    strong desire to do the very best we possibly can as a Company. Every job represents a new challenge
                    and a new opportunity to
                    demonstrate our quality workmanship, our Company pride and the dedication of our employees
