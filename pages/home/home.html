            <p>
                We are an Asphalt Paving firm whose operations began in 1932. Throughout the years, Grady Brothers, Inc.
                has demonstrated its ability to construct and complete asphalt paving on environmental areas,
                recreational,
                transportation, commercial, industrial and residential areas.

                With the latest computerized and technical machinery and equipment for use in its asphalt construction.
                The company is also utilizing its ability to recycle old asphalt pavements through its asphalt plant
                when
                producing asphalt mixes. This recycle process aids in the conservation of aggregates and liquid asphalt
                material and is a cost saving factor for its many customers.

            <h1>WHAT IS ASPHALT?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Hot-mix asphalt is made by mixing dried and heated quality
                aggregates with hot asphalt cement in a mixing plant. The
                required amount of each ingredient is carefully measured
                and mixed together under controlled conditions to produce
                a uniform mixture. The mixture is transported, placed and
                compacted while still hot. Specially designed paving
                machines place the mixture to the required thickness and
                grade specifications; after the mixture has been rolled to
                desired compaction density, the surface is ready for
                immediate use.</p>
