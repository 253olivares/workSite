# Coding Repository for GradyBrothersSite [OLD]

This was an organization I was previously affiliated with.

The original site was created back in 2010 and during my time with the company, I decided to update their webpage to provide them with a more up-to-date web presence. 

This being one of my first professional coding sites I recreated the website for them in September 2022 

The site utilizes HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, SASS, and PHP

HTML CSS JS JQUERY - handles all the page navigation and styling allowing the user to navigate the site

PHP - handling the mailing form. Allowing visitors to get in touch.

This page utilizes single-page application practice and was built to be responsive allowing users to view the website on their handheld device. 

Frameworks: None (No framework was utilized at the time of this project)

Updates Nov / Dec 2023: The site was reconstructed by me again in 2023 near the end before I left the company to fix any ongoing bugs that existed since my original creation of the site in 2022. 

The site design was mocked and created using Adobe XD which can be found in the root directory. 

# *June 2024 - Site design is no longer being utilized Git hub remains to document my work and a git pages will be created for portfolio use.*
