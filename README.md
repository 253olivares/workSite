# Coding Repository for [GradyBrothers.com](https://www.gradybros.com/ "GradyBrothers.com")

This was an orgainzation I was previously affiliated with.

Original site was create back in 2010 and during my time with the company I decided to update their webpage to provide them with a more up to date web presence. 

This being one of my first professional coding sites I reccreated the website for them in September of 2022 

The site utilizes htmls, css, javascript, jquery, scss, and php

HTML CSS JS JQUERY - handels all the page navigation and styling allowing the user to navigate the site

PHP - handeling the mailing form. Allowing visitors to get in touch.

This page utilizes single page application practice and was build to be responsive allowing users to view the website on thein handheld device. 

Frameworks: None (No framework was utilized at the time of this project)

Updates: Site was reconstructed by me again in 2023 near the end before I left the company to fix any on going bugs that existed since my original create of the site in 2022.  I continue to update the site when needed by the company. 

Site design was mocked and created using adobe XD which can be found in the root directory.
