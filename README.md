# Coding Repository for [GradyBrothers.com](https://www.gradybros.com/ "GradyBrothers.com")

This was an organization I was previously affiliated with.

The original site was created back in 2010 and during my time with the company, I decided to update their webpage to provide them with a more up-to-date web presence. 

This being one of my first professional coding sites I recreated the website for them in September of 2022 

The site utilizes HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, SASS, and PHP

HTML CSS JS JQUERY - handles all the page navigation and styling allowing the user to navigate the site

PHP - handling the mailing form. Allowing visitors to get in touch.

This page utilizes single-page application practice and was built to be responsive allowing users to view the website on thein handheld device. 

Frameworks: None (No framework was utilized at the time of this project)

Updates: The site was reconstructed by me again in 2023 near the end before I left the company to fix any ongoing bugs that existed since my original creation of the site in 2022.  I continue to update the site when needed by the company. 

The site design was mocked and created using Adobe XD which can be found in the root directory.
